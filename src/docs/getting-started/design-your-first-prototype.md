5. Click on `Add Basic Elements` button, and select `Text (T)`. Click and drag to add a text box.

::: warning IMPORTANT

You can simply press `T` in your keyboard to activate the type tool.  
Similarly look for shortcuts given with all the tools.
:::

6. Type in a text you want. For example "My App".

9. Add a `Primary Button` widget into your screen

::: warning IMPORTANT
When clicked on a widget, an instance of that widget will be added to the screen, but this instance will be attached to the mouse pointer. Move the widget to the desired location and click again to fix the position.

10. Add another screen repeating the same steps used to create the first one.

::: tip
You have hold `spacebar` in your keyboard and move the `mouse` to pan in the canvas.
:::

11. Add a text and a `Back` button, to the second screen. `Double Click` on the button to edit the label to "Back".

13. Click on the button in the first screen. A `Handle` will be displayed on the middle of the right edge.

::: tip
You can hold `Ctrl` or `Cmd` on your keyboard and scroll your `Mouse Up` and `Mouse Down` to zoom in and zoom out of the canvas, respectively.
:::

14. Click on the `Handle` once so that a `Wire` will get attached to the mouse pointer. Move the mouse to the second screen and click inside the screen one more time to release the `Wire` and finalise the connection.

15. Similarly add another connection from back button in the second screen to the first screen.

### Simulate

With all the `Wire`s in place, we can simulate the app.

16. Click on the `Start Simulation` button to launch the app in simulation mode.
