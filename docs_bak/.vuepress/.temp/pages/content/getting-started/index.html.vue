<p>Quant-UX is a free and open-source research and analysis tool for quantitative analysis of design prototypes.</p>
<h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overview"><span>Overview</span></a></h2>
<p>Quant-UX supports building prototypes and sharing it for testing. The screens of the prototypes are composed of basic UI elements called <strong>widgets</strong>. Common examples will be buttons, switches, text field, etc. These are not just visual elements acting as placeholders, but <em>independent, functional, and customisable components</em>, which can be used to quickly create highly interactive wireframes and prototypes.</p>
<p>After specifying the required 'Tests', the prototypes can be shared with others for testing by simply <strong>sharing a link</strong>. During the testing user interactions and various analytics metrics are captured, and these results are presented in a easy to analyse dashboards. Quant-UX also supports seeing various test results over the prototype itself to make informed design decisions.</p>
